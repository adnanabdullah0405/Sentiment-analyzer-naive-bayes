# Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes and NLTK 
This project implements a sentiment analysis classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm and NLTK. It analyzes input text or reviews and predicts whether the sentiment is positive or negative. Includes preprocessing, evaluation, and accuracy reporting.

##  Overview

This project implements a **Sentiment Analysis model** using the **Naive Bayes algorithm** and the **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** library. The model takes in raw text or product reviews and classifies the sentiment as **positive** or **negative**. This project emphasizes core NLP techniques including text cleaning, tokenization, feature extraction, and probabilistic classification.
